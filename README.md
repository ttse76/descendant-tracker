# Descendant Tracker for Crusader Kings 3

Descendant Tracker will be a trait that you can add to your custom character.

This trait will be passed on to all the descendants of your original character even if they are a part of a different dynasty. It will give other characters with this trait +5 opinion of you as you both share the same great ancestor.

Currently in the bug fixing phase with a release on the Steam workshop planned soon.
